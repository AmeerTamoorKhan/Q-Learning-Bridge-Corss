# Q-Learning-Bridge-Corss

The agent(Blue cube) is trained to reach the goal position(Green cube). The agnet is required to cross the broken bridges(Blue strips) by putting block(Red cube) to pave the path.

******Reinforcement Learning******

The agent explores the environment on its own without any prior data and based on the action it takes and the reward it gets on each action, the agent tries to maximize that reward.

In the given case, the agent's goal is to reach the final position (Green cube) while crossing the broken bridges (Blue strips). Every time it lands on green cube it gets a reward of +10, likewise, +20 reward for placing block (Red cube) on the right patch, and -1 otherwise. The number on each tile represents the action that the agent will take on a particular tile.

0 => Go Left

1 => Go Up

2 => Go Right

3 => Go Down
